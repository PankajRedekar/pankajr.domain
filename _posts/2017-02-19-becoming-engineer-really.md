Corporate world is the place where business ethics and laws apply and must followed, with 
certain other specific behaviors that must be met to get ahead in such world. 
It is labeled as a ‘corporate world’ because it is very different from the ‘real world’.


When we talk about corporate world the only one picture comes into our mind is person with 
suit and tie. And yes, that’s real fact about corporate world after completing graduation 
everyone wants to be the part of the corporate world. A New Delhi-based employment solutions 
company, Aspiring Minds, conducted an employability-focused study based on 150,000 engineering 
students. The findings were rather shocking. As many as 97% of graduating engineers want jobs 
either in software engineering or core engineering. However, only 3% have suitable skills to be 
employed in software or product market.

# And two major problems with engineering:


## Lack of innovation and research in Institutes:


> “Research serves to make building stones out of stumbling blocks.” – Arthur D. Little.


The recent revelations about India’s lack of research mindset exposed the chinks in the 
armor of Indian education. Three popular surveys namely THE-WUR, ARWU and QS unfolds that 
Indian institutions stood nowhere within the top 200 institutions in the world. It clearly 
conveys the message that we need to work to make our research stronger to become academically 
strong and keep in pace with the global academicians. The surveys create several doubts in the 
minds of many intellectuals and call for immediate action.


We Indians often emphasize on quantity, not quality of research. We are not willing to wait 
patiently, and we often blame external reasons for our weaknesses. We may also question the surveys 
as biased. It is time for introspection. 


Recently Indian President, Pranab Mukhaerjee expressed his displeasure as follows
> “I feel it necessary to share with you my sense of dismay on seeing, in recent reports, 
that not a single Indian university or institute of higher learning, including the premier IITs, 
figure on the list of 200 top-rated universities of the world. Now you may question the survey, 
but, to my mind the more important question is: Why? Why are we .. not able to promote our standards 
to be rated, indisputably, among the top 10 or even top 50 or 100?”

## Lack of skill-based education:


The report, titled “Pearson Voice of Teachers Survey”, said 92 % of teachers agree that the Indian 
education system is focused on exams due to which the students lack the required academic, cognitive, and 
vocational skills. As result, half of the students entering a class or grade lack the skill required for that 
level, signifying low orientation of the low orientation of the system on skill development. Engineering students 
need to have hands-on training based on the problems they are likely to encounter in the real world.


> “One of the major problems facing the fresh graduates is their insufficient understanding of basic concepts. 
The lack of in-depth understanding of technical information and insufficient knowledge across domains are the major skill gaps in the area.” – Siddarth Bharwani, VP, Jetking Infotrain ltd.


While the vast numbers of engineering students in the country study their textbooks, give their exam and collect their degrees, 
it is only when they encounter the real-world problems do they realize their shortfall. By then, they have to take extra time to 
skill themselves or suffer unemployment.
