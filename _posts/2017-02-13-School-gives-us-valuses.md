School life is very important part of one's life, because it provides opportunity for study and discipline. 
Besides these, the school life is a preparatory stage for entering public life.


School plays an important role in widening the outlook of students. Virtues such as perseverance, sincerity, truthfulness, 
tolerance, discipline and obedience developed in pupils. School provides opportunity to the students to be disciplined. 
They show discipline in class room, play ground, hostel, and library at other places.


School is a meeting place of students and teachers. From here, a student learns how to adjust himself with the society 
at later part of life.


The school life is generally a period of youth. 
In school, all the students read in a spirit of togetherness. They forget their joys and sorrows. They read together, 
play together and sit together. In these days their minds contain some youthful dreams which come true as they grow in age.


School is the right place for the fulfillment of the youthful desires. 
Students take part in games and sports, drama, essay competition, song and debate competitions etc. School also gives 
the foundation for the budding poets, scientists, writers, doctors, engineers, painters and musicians. 
It is in school that the students enjoy the affection of their teachers.


Teachers act as the guides and guardians to guide them on the right path. In school, teachers try to 
remove the evils from the students by sowing some seeds of good qualities in them.
